# Confluence Editing Standards (Markdown Authoring)

Purpose: Ensure Markdown renders cleanly in Confluence by applying spacing, nesting, and code formatting rules during page creation/updates.

## Lists & Spacing
- Always insert a blank line between list items.

- Use nested sub-bullets for subpoints; never concatenate multiple points on a single line.

- For ordered lists, keep each step single-purpose; add an empty line between steps when a step has sub-bullets.

## Inline vs Code Blocks
- Prefer inline code for short, single-line commands or file paths (e.g., `composer install`).

- Use fenced code blocks only when necessary (multi-line commands, config snippets). Verify Confluence renders the block without collapsing; otherwise, convert to inline steps.

- Do not mix bullets and code blocks without a blank line before and after the block.

## Headings & Anchors
- Keep headings concise; avoid trailing punctuation.

- When using Markdown format, avoid enabling heading anchors if they introduce ID artifacts in rendered output.

## Tables
- Keep tables simple (5–7 columns max). Prefer bullets when content wraps heavily.

- Add a brief sentence above a large table explaining what it captures.

## Nested Structure
- Depth guidance: limit nesting to two levels (bullet → sub-bullet). If content requires more depth, split into a new subsection.

## Check Before Publish (Quicklist)
- Bullets have blank lines between items.

- Sub-bullets are properly indented and grouped.

- Commands are inline where possible; multi-line blocks tested for rendering.

- No anchor artifacts in headings.

- Tables are readable; consider bullets if wide.

## Optional Page Label Cue
When editing an existing Confluence page, if the page has label `format-spaced-lists`, apply these spacing rules strictly even if the original content is inconsistent.
