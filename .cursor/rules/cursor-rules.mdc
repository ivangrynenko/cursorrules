      When creating or updating Cursor rules:

      1. **Location:**
         - Always place rule files in **PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/**:
           ```
           .cursor/rules/
           ├── your-rule-name.mdc
           ├── another-rule.mdc
           └── ...
           ```

      2. **Naming Convention:**
         - Use **kebab-case** for filenames
         - Always use the **.mdc** extension
         - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

      3. **Directory Structure:**
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .cursor/
         │   └── rules/
         │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         │       └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      4. **Placement Restrictions:**
         - Never place rule files:
           - In the project root
           - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
           - In any other location

      5. **Maintenance:**
         - **When adding new rules or modifying existing ones**, ensure to:
           - Review and possibly update **related project rules** or **global rules** to maintain consistency and reflect changes in project standards or practices.
           - Check if the modification impacts other parts of your project or documentation, updating them accordingly.

      **Suggestion to Update Rules:**
      - After modifying or creating a rule, Cursor should suggest:
        - "Consider updating [related rule name] to reflect these changes."
        - "Ensure all global rules that might be affected by this change are reviewed."
