# Cursor Rule Authoring Standards

Standards for storing and maintaining Cursor rule files so every project installs consistent guidance.

> Priority: high · Version: 1.2

## Applies To
- `*.mdc`

## Trigger Conditions
- New or modified rule files within the repository.
- Rule files created outside `.cursor/rules/`.
- Rules that still use the legacy `<rule>` XML-style format.

## Hard Stops

- Cursor rule files must live under `.cursor/rules/` in the project root.
- Migrate any legacy `<rule>...</rule>` blocks to front matter + Markdown content.

## Recommended Structure

# Rule Title

Introductory paragraph that explains scope and intent.

> Priority: <low|medium|high> · Version: <semver>

## Applies To
- `*.ext`

## Trigger Conditions
- Bulleted list describing when reviewers should reference the rule.

## Required Checks / Recommendations / Positive Signals
- Use headings that suit the rule's enforcement style.
- Keep bullets short, actionable, and framework-agnostic.
- Include validation or positive examples when useful.

## References
- Optional external documentation or internal playbooks.
```

## Maintenance Checklist
- Group related rules using consistent prefixes (e.g. `drupal-*`, `lagoon-*`).
- Keep filenames kebab-cased with the `.mdc` extension.
- Review neighbouring rules to avoid duplication or conflicting guidance.
- Record significant rule updates (scope changes, removals) in commit messages or release notes.
- Test rules against representative code snippets before distributing updates.
- Refresh installer documentation and downstream repositories after introducing new rules.

## Examples
### Correct Placement
```
.cursor/rules/php-drupal-development-standards.mdc
.cursor/rules/security-practices.mdc
```
Outcome: Rules are discoverable by Cursor and downstream tooling.

### Incorrect Placement
```
rules/php-rule.mdc
cursor-rules/drupal.mdc
```
Outcome: Rules outside `.cursor/rules/` will be ignored by Cursor installers.
