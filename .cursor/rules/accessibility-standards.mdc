# Accessibility Standards

Ensures WCAG compliance and accessibility best practices.

> Priority: high Â· Version: 1.1

## Applies To
- `*.vue`
- `*.jsx`
- `*.tsx`
- `*.html`
- `*.php`

## Trigger Conditions
- Files matching pattern `\.(vue|jsx|tsx|html|php|css|scss|sass)$`

## Required Checks

- Images must have alt attributes for screen readers.
- ARIA attributes should not be empty; provide meaningful values.
- Buttons should have meaningful, descriptive content.
- Links with href='#' should either be removed or have an aria-label for context.
- Form inputs should include an aria-label or aria-labelledby attribute for better screen reader support.
- Videos should include captions for accessibility.

## Recommendations

**Accessibility Best Practices:**
- **Heading Hierarchy:** Use headings (h1 to h6) in a logical order to structure content.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.
- **Semantic HTML:** Favor semantic elements like <nav>, <article>, <section>, and <aside> for better structure comprehension.
- **Color Contrast:** Check color contrast ratios meet WCAG guidelines (4.5:1 for normal text, 7:1 for large text).
- **Skip Navigation Links:** Provide 'skip to main content' links for keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation.
- **Focus Management:** Ensure focus indicators are visible and manage focus for modal dialogs or dynamic content changes.
- **Form Labels:** Associate labels with form controls using the 'for' attribute or wrap controls with <label>.
- **Descriptive Links:** Use descriptive text for links, avoiding generic phrases like "click here."
- **Touch Targets:** Ensure touch target sizes are large enough (at least 44x44 pixels) for mobile users.
- **Timeouts:** Avoid or provide options to extend time limits where possible, or warn users before session expiry.
- **Language Attribute:** Set the lang attribute on the <html> element to indicate the primary language of the page.
