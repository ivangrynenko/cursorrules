## Rule Details

- **Name:** accessibility_standards

- **Description:** Enforce accessibility standards and WCAG compliance

## Enforcement Checks
- Conditions:
  - pattern `<img[^>]+(?!alt=)[^>]*>` – Images must have alt attributes for screen readers.
  - pattern `aria-[a-z]+=\"\"` – ARIA attributes should not be empty; provide meaningful values.
  - pattern `<button[^>]*>(?![^<]*[^\\s])[^<]*</button>` – Buttons should have meaningful, descriptive content.
  - pattern `<a[^>]*href=\"#[^\"]*\"[^>]*>(?![^<]*<svg)[^<]*</a>` – Links with href='#' should either be removed or have an aria-label for context.
  - pattern `<input[^>]+type=\"(text|email|password|search|tel|url)\"[^>]*>` – negated `aria-label|aria-labelledby|title` – Form inputs should include an aria-label or aria-labelledby attribute for better screen reader support.
  - pattern `<video[^>]*>(?!<track)[^<]*</video>` – Videos should include captions for accessibility.

## Suggestions
- Guidance:
**Accessibility Best Practices:**
- **Heading Hierarchy:** Use headings (h1 to h6) in a logical order to structure content.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.
- **Semantic HTML:** Favor semantic elements like <nav>, <article>, <section>, and <aside> for better structure comprehension.
- **Color Contrast:** Check color contrast ratios meet WCAG guidelines (4.5:1 for normal text, 7:1 for large text).
- **Skip Navigation Links:** Provide 'skip to main content' links for keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation.
- **Focus Management:** Ensure focus indicators are visible and manage focus for modal dialogs or dynamic content changes.
- **Form Labels:** Associate labels with form controls using the 'for' attribute or wrap controls with <label>.
- **Descriptive Links:** Use descriptive text for links, avoiding generic phrases like "click here."
- **Touch Targets:** Ensure touch target sizes are large enough (at least 44x44 pixels) for mobile users.
- **Timeouts:** Avoid or provide options to extend time limits where possible, or warn users before session expiry.
- **Language Attribute:** Set the lang attribute on the <html> element to indicate the primary language of the page.
