# Comprehensive Project Definition Template

This rule enforces best practices for documenting project context, ensuring clarity and maintainability through well-documented README files and documentation.

> Priority: medium Â· Version: 1.1

## Applies To
- `README.md`
- `/docs/*`

## Trigger Conditions
- Files matching pattern `\.md$`
- Paths matching `README.md|/docs/`

## Required Checks

- Define the purpose of the project in the README file, including its goals and objectives.
- List the technical stack used in the project in the README file, including language versions and frameworks.
- Document the folder structure in the README file with a brief explanation for each significant directory.
- Include any custom themes, modules, or libraries in the README file, explaining their functionality.
- List any third-party libraries used in the project in the README file, including versions for reproducibility.
- Provide clear setup instructions in the README to help new contributors or users get started.
- Document contribution guidelines if the project is open-source or team-based.

## Recommendations

**Project Definition Best Practices:**
- **README and Docs:** Use both README.md for an overview and /docs/ for detailed documentation.
- **Project Purpose:** Clearly articulate why the project exists, its objectives, and who it serves.
- **Technical Stack:** Include all technologies, versions, and possibly why each was chosen.
- **Folder Structure:** Use tree diagrams or simple bullet points to describe the project's layout.
- **Customizations:** Explain any custom code, including its purpose and how it integrates with the project.
- **Libraries:** Detail external dependencies, why they're used, and how to manage them (e.g., npm, composer).
- **Setup Instructions:** Provide step-by-step guidance for setting up the project environment.
- **Contribution Guidelines:** Outline how to contribute, including coding standards, branch management, and pull request process.
- **License:** Include information about the project's licensing for legal clarity.
- **Roadmap:** Optionally, add a roadmap section to discuss future plans or features.

## Validation

- Ensure the project purpose is clearly defined for understanding the project's intent.
- Ensure the technical stack is documented to aid in tech stack comprehension.
- Ensure the folder structure is outlined for navigation ease.
- Ensure customizations are documented for understanding unique project elements.
- Ensure libraries are listed for dependency management.
- Ensure setup instructions are included to facilitate onboarding.
