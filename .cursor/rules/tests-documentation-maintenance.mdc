# Tests & Documentation Maintenance

Ensures that tests are written and updated for Drupal modules and plugins, and that documentation remains current.

> Priority: high Â· Version: 1.0

## Applies To
- `*.php`
- `*.feature`
- `README.md`
- `*.md`

## Trigger Conditions
- Files matching pattern `\.(php|feature|md|theme|module|install|info|inc)$`

## Required Checks

- Ensure all Drupal modules and plugins have unit tests.
- Ensure front-end affecting plugins have Behat tests.
- When modifying existing functionality, check and update related tests.
- Ensure README.md exists in each module and is kept up to date.

## Recommendations

Keep tests and documentation updated:
- Write **unit tests** for Drupal modules and backend logic.
- Write **Behat tests** for plugins that affect front-end behavior.
- If functionality changes, **update corresponding tests**.
- Maintain a **README.md** file in each module and update it with relevant changes.
