# AI Query Efficiency & Auto-Optimization

Ensures Cursor analyzes AI query efficiency, detects repeated requests, and automatically updates relevant rules to improve response quality.

description: Analyze AI query efficiency and optimize rules to prevent repeated requests.

      - Identify inefficiencies in AI responses.
      - Suggest improvements in query structure or Cursor usage.
      - Automatically update relevant Cursor rules to enhance efficiency.

  - type: suggest
    message: |
      You seem to be making multiple requests for the same type of response. Consider:
      
      1. Refining your prompt to be more specific.
      2. Reviewing past responses for insights before retrying.
      3. Using structured queries for better AI comprehension.
      4. Allowing Cursor to automatically optimize related rules to avoid repeated issues.
