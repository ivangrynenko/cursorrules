## üì• Installation

### Interactive Installation (Recommended)

For a fully interactive installation with prompts:

```bash
# Step 1: Download the installer
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php -o install.php

# Step 2: Run the installer interactively
php install.php
```

This two-step process ensures you get the interactive experience with:
- Prompts to choose which rule sets to install (Core, Web Stack, Python, or All)
- Option to remove the installer file after installation (defaults to yes)

### Quick Non-Interactive Installation

For a quick installation without prompts (installs core rules only):

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php
```

or install rules by tag expression
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --tags "language:javascript category:security"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: When using the curl piping method above, interactive mode is **not possible** because STDIN is already being used for the script input. The installer will automatically default to installing core rules only.

### Installation with Specific Options

To install with specific options and bypass the interactive mode:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- [options]
```

For example, to install all rules:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --all
```

### Installation Options

The installer supports the following options:
- `--core`: Install core rules only
- `--web-stack` or `--ws`: Install web stack rules (includes core rules)
- `--python`: Install Python rules (includes core rules)
- `--all`: Install all rules
- `--yes` or `-y`: Automatically answer yes to all prompts
- `--destination=DIR`: Install to a custom directory (default: .cursor/rules)
- `--debug`: Enable detailed debug output for troubleshooting installation issues
- `--ignore-files <opt>`: Control installation of .cursorignore files (yes, no, ask), default's to yes
- `--help` or `-h`: Show help message

### .cursorignore Files

The installer can automatically add recommended `.cursorignore` and `.cursorindexingignore` files to your project. These files tell Cursor AI which files and directories to exclude from processing, which helps to:

- **Improve performance** by skipping large generated files, vendor directories, and node_modules
- **Reduce noise** in AI responses by focusing only on relevant project files
- **Prevent unnecessary context** from third-party code being included in AI prompts

The `.cursorignore` file ensures files are not indexed by Cursior and they are not read by Cursor or sent to the models for processing. This is a good setting for files that may contain secrets or other information you'd prefer to keep private. The `.cursorindexingignore` file is just for indexing and is there mainly for performance reasons.

By default, the installer will add these files (controlled by the `--ignore-files` option). You can:
- Set to `yes` (default): Always install ignore files
- Set to `no`: Never install ignore files
- Set to `ask`: Prompt during installation

If you need to modify the ignore patterns, you can edit the `.cursorignore` files manually after installation.

### Troubleshooting Installation

If you encounter issues during installation, try running the installer with the debug option:

```bash
php install.php --debug
```

This will provide detailed information about what the installer is doing, which can help identify the source of any problems.

Common issues:
- If only core rules are installed when selecting other options, make sure your internet connection is working properly as the installer needs to download additional rules from GitHub.
- If you're behind a corporate firewall or proxy, you may need to configure PHP to use your proxy settings.

### Examples

Install core rules only:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --core
```

Install web stack rules (includes core rules):
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --web-stack
# Or using the shorter alias
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --ws
```

Install all rules:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --all
```

Install to a custom directory:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --all --destination=my/custom/path
```

#### Tag-Based Selection

The installer now supports filtering rules by tags, allowing you to install only the rules relevant to your project:

```sh
# Install all JavaScript security rules
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --tags "language:javascript category:security"

# Install all OWASP Top 10 rules for PHP
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --tags "language:php standard:owasp-top10"

# Install all React-related rules
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --tags "framework:react"

# Install rules matching multiple criteria with OR logic
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --tags "language:javascript OR language:php"
```

Available tag presets:
- `web`: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP
- `frontend`: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- `drupal`: Drupal-specific rules
- `react`: React-specific rules
- `vue`: Vue-specific rules
- `python`: Python-specific rules
- `security`: Security-focused rules
- `owasp`: OWASP Top 10 rules
- `a11y`: Accessibility rules
- `php-security`: PHP security-focused rules
- `js-security`: JavaScript security-focused rules
- `python-security`: Python security-focused rules
- `drupal-security`: Drupal security-focused rules
- `php-owasp`: PHP OWASP Top 10 rules
- `js-owasp`: JavaScript OWASP Top 10 rules
- `python-owasp`: Python OWASP Top 10 rules
- `drupal-owasp`: Drupal OWASP Top 10 rules

See the [TAG_STANDARDS.md](TAG_STANDARDS.md) file for detailed information about the tagging system.

### Recommendations for Users

1. **Selective Rule Usage**:
   - Disable rules not relevant to your specific technology stack
   - Configure rule priorities based on your project's needs
   - Consider creating custom installation scripts that only install relevant rules

2. **Performance Optimisation**:
   - If experiencing slowdowns, review which rules are most frequently triggered
   - Consider disabling computationally expensive rules for very large files
   - Report performance issues so rule patterns can be optimised

3. **Custom Rule Development**:
   - When creating custom rules, follow the patterns established in existing rules
   - Use specific file filters to minimise unnecessary rule evaluation
   - Test new rules thoroughly in isolation before adding to the collection

### Future Scalability Plans

While maintaining all rules in a single repository currently provides the best developer experience, we're preparing for potential future growth:

1. **Enhanced Categorisation**:
   - Rules include clear language/framework tagging with a structured hierarchical system (As seen in the OWASP Top Ten Rules):
     - `language:php` - Explicitly identifies the programming language
     - `framework:drupal` - Specifies the framework or CMS
     - `category:security` - Defines the primary functional category
     - `subcategory:injection` - Provides more granular categorisation (e.g., injection, authentication)
     - `standard:owasp-top10` - Identifies the security standard being applied
     - `risk:a01-broken-access-control` - Specifies the exact risk identifier
   - This tagging system enables selective installation based on language, framework, or security concern
   - Installation scripts can target specific categories (e.g., only install PHP rules or only OWASP rules)

2. **Modular Design**:
   - Rule file structure supports potential future separation
   - Consistent naming conventions facilitate organisation

3. **Monitoring and Feedback**:
   - Repository growth and performance impacts are monitored
   - User feedback helps identify optimisation opportunities

If you encounter any issues with rule management or have suggestions for improving organisation, please submit an issue or pull request.
