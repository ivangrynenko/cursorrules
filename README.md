## üîß Installation

You can install these rules using one of the following methods:

### Option 1: Quick Install (Recommended)

Run this command in your project root:

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php
```

This will:
1. Download and run the installer
2. Create the `.cursor/rules` directory if it doesn't exist
3. Install all Cursor rules
4. Remove the installer script automatically

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. **Clone this repository** into your project:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules.git
cd cursor-rules
```

2. **Copy the rules into your project's .cursor/rules/ directory:**
```sh
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
cp .cursor/rules/*.mdc .cursor/rules/
```

After installation, the rules will automatically be used by Cursor AI in your workflow.

## ü§ñ Using Cursor AI

To enhance your documentation and ensure it remains up-to-date, consider using **Cursor AI** itself. The **"cursor-small"** model can assist in updating your README.md file based on the rules and context defined in your project. 

### Steps to Use Cursor AI:
1. **Invoke Cursor AI** with the context of your project.
2. **Request updates** for the README.md file.
3. **Review the suggested changes** and ensure they align with your project goals.

## üìã Role-Based Development

This repository implements a multi-agent development workflow with two primary roles:

### Planner Role
- Performs high-level analysis
- Breaks down tasks into manageable units
- Defines success criteria
- Evaluates progress
- Uses high-intelligence models for planning

### Executor Role
- Implements specific tasks
- Writes and tests code
- Reports progress
- Raises questions or blockers
- Follows Planner's directives

## üìù Workflow Guidelines

1. **Task Initialization**
   - Planner analyzes requirements
   - Documents background and motivation
   - Creates high-level task breakdown

2. **Development Cycle**
   - Executor implements tasks
   - Reports progress regularly
   - Raises questions when blocked
   - Planner reviews and adjusts plans

3. **Quality Control**
   - Planner verifies task completion
   - Cross-checks against success criteria
   - Provides feedback for improvements

4. **Documentation**
   - Track progress in structured format
   - Maintain clear communication records
   - Document lessons learned

## üìù Initial Setup Steps

### Option 1: Define Your Project Context Using Cursor AI
- After adding the rules to your project, use the **Cursor AI** and the **"cursor-small"** model to document your project's purpose, technical stack, folder structure, customizations, and libraries.
- **Steps to Use Cursor AI:**
  1. **Invoke Cursor AI** with the context of your project.
  2. **Request updates** for the README.md file.
  3. **Review the suggested changes** and ensure they align with your project goals.

### Option 2: Manual Definition of Your Project Context
1. **Define Your Project Context:**
   - Search for the README file and `/docs/` folder to gather context.
   - Use the `project-definition-template.mdc` rule to document your project's purpose, technical stack, folder structure, customizations, and libraries.

2. **Follow the Guidelines:**
   - Update the README file with the necessary sections as outlined in the project definition rule.
   - Maintain clear and concise documentation for future reference.

3. **Continue with Other Rules:**
   - Once the project context is defined, proceed to implement other rules to enhance code quality and maintainability.
