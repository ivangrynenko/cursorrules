## üì• Installation

### Interactive Installation (Recommended)

For a fully interactive installation with prompts:

```bash
# Step 1: Download the installer
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php -o install.php

# Step 2: Run the installer interactively
php install.php
```

This two-step process ensures you get the interactive experience with:
- Prompts to choose which rule sets to install (Core, Web Stack, Python, or All)
- Option to remove the installer file after installation (defaults to yes)

### Quick Non-Interactive Installation

For a quick installation without prompts (installs core rules only):

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: When using the curl piping method above, interactive mode is **not possible** because STDIN is already being used for the script input. The installer will automatically default to installing core rules only.

### Installation with Specific Options

To install with specific options and bypass the interactive mode:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- [options]
```

For example, to install all rules:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --all
```

### Installation Options

The installer supports the following options:
- `--core`: Install core rules only
- `--web-stack` or `--ws`: Install web stack rules (includes core rules)
- `--python`: Install Python rules (includes core rules)
- `--all`: Install all rules
- `--yes` or `-y`: Automatically answer yes to all prompts
- `--destination=DIR`: Install to a custom directory (default: .cursor/rules)
- `--debug`: Enable detailed debug output for troubleshooting installation issues
- `--help` or `-h`: Show help message

### Troubleshooting Installation

If you encounter issues during installation, try running the installer with the debug option:

```bash
php install.php --debug
```

This will provide detailed information about what the installer is doing, which can help identify the source of any problems.

Common issues:
- If only core rules are installed when selecting other options, make sure your internet connection is working properly as the installer needs to download additional rules from GitHub.
- If you're behind a corporate firewall or proxy, you may need to configure PHP to use your proxy settings.

### Examples

Install core rules only:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --core
```

Install web stack rules (includes core rules):
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --web-stack
# Or using the shorter alias
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --ws
```

Install all rules:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --all
```

Install to a custom directory:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --all --destination=my/custom/path
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules.git
   ```

2. Copy the rules to your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /path/to/your/project/.cursor/rules
   cp -r cursor-rules/.cursor/rules/* /path/to/your/project/.cursor/rules/
   ```

   - Configure rule priorities based on your project's needs
   - Consider creating custom installation scripts that only install relevant rules

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - If experiencing slowdowns, review which rules are most frequently triggered
   - Consider disabling computationally expensive rules for very large files
   - Report performance issues so rule patterns can be optimized

3. **Custom Rule Development**:
   - When creating custom rules, follow the patterns established in existing rules
   - Use specific file filters to minimize unnecessary rule evaluation
   - Test new rules thoroughly in isolation before adding to the collection

### Future Scalability Plans

While maintaining all rules in a single repository currently provides the best developer experience, we're preparing for potential future growth:

1. **Enhanced Categorization**:
   - Rules include clear language/framework tagging with a structured hierarchical system (As seen in the OWASP Top Ten Rules):
     - `language:php` - Explicitly identifies the programming language
     - `framework:drupal` - Specifies the framework or CMS
     - `category:security` - Defines the primary functional category
     - `subcategory:injection` - Provides more granular categorization (e.g., injection, authentication)
     - `standard:owasp-top10` - Identifies the security standard being applied
     - `risk:a01-broken-access-control` - Specifies the exact risk identifier
   - This tagging system enables selective installation based on language, framework, or security concern
   - Installation scripts can target specific categories (e.g., only install PHP rules or only OWASP rules)

2. **Modular Design**:
   - Rule file structure supports potential future separation
   - Consistent naming conventions facilitate organization

3. **Monitoring and Feedback**:
   - Repository growth and performance impacts are monitored
   - User feedback helps identify optimization opportunities

If you encounter any issues with rule management or have suggestions for improving organization, please submit an issue or pull request.
