   - **Web Stack** (Drupal, PHP, JavaScript, CSS + core rules)
   - **Python** (Python, Django, Flask + core rules)
   - **All Rules** (Install everything, includes core rules)
   - **Core Rules Only** (Install only essential rules)
   - **Tag-Based Selection** (Filter rules by tags)
   - **Custom Selection** (Choose specific rule sets)
3. Create the `.cursor/rules` directory if it doesn't exist
4. Install all selected Cursor rules
5. Install the UPDATE.md file with instructions for future updates

## üîí Security Features

### Default .cursorignore File

This repository includes a default `.cursorignore` file that prevents Cursor from analysing sensitive or irrelevant files. This improves both security and performance by excluding files like:

- Version control directories (`.git/`)
- Dependency directories (`node_modules/`, `vendor/`)
- Environment and secret files (`.env`, `*.key`, `*secret*`)
- Private keys and certificates (`*.pem`, `*.p12`)
- Build artifacts and temporary files

When you install the cursor rules, the `.cursorignore` file is automatically copied to your project root directory.

### Secret Detection Rule

The repository includes a dedicated rule for detecting potential secrets and sensitive data in code files:

| File Name | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| [`secret-detection.mdc`](.cursor/rules/secret-detection.mdc) | Detect and warn about potential secrets, API keys, and credentials in code |

This rule helps prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information by identifying common patterns for:
- API keys and tokens
- Database credentials
- Private keys and certificates
- Hardcoded passwords
- Connection strings
- OAuth tokens
- JWT tokens
- AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure credentials

When detected, the rule provides warnings and suggests best practices for secure secret management.

### Intelligent OWASP Rule Selection

The installer now features intelligent OWASP rule selection based on language tags:

- When you specify a language tag (e.g., `language:php`) along with security-related tags (e.g., `category:security` or `standard:owasp-top10`), the installer automatically includes all relevant OWASP rules for that language.
- Language-specific security presets are available for quick installation of security rules for specific languages.
- The secret detection rule is now included in all installations by default to ensure basic security coverage.

Example:
```sh
# This will automatically include all PHP OWASP rules
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --tags "language:php standard:owasp-top10"

# This will include all JavaScript security rules
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivangrynenko/cursor-rules/main/install.php | php -- --tag-preset js-security
```

The interactive installer also includes a new "Security Focus" option that allows you to select language-specific security rules.

## üè∑Ô∏è Tag-Based Rule Selection

The repository includes a Python script for selecting cursor rules based on tags. This allows you to install only the rules relevant to your project:

```sh
# Install rules based on a tag query
python scripts/select_rules.py --query "language:javascript AND category:security" --target-dir /path/to/project/.cursor/rules

# Install rules using a preset
python scripts/select_rules.py --preset web --target-dir /path/to/project/.cursor/rules

# List matching rules without copying
python scripts/select_rules.py --preset python --list-only
```

Available presets:
- `web`: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP
- `frontend`: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Vue, Angular
- `backend`: PHP, Python, Node.js
- `drupal`: Drupal-specific rules
- `react`: React-specific rules
- `vue`: Vue-specific rules
- `python`: Python-specific rules
- `security`: Security-focused rules
- `owasp`: OWASP Top 10 rules
- `a11y`: Accessibility rules
- `core`: Essential core rules

See the [TAG_STANDARDS.md](TAG_STANDARDS.md) file for detailed information about tags, including:
- Tag structure and hierarchy
- Primary tag categories
- Guidelines for using and adding tags
- Example tag queries

## üìã Role-Based Development

This repository implements a multi-agent development workflow with two primary roles:

### Planner Role
- Performs high-level analysis
- Breaks down tasks into manageable units

## üìù Initial Setup Steps

### Option 1: Define Your Project Context Using Cursor AI
- After adding the rules to your project, use the **Cursor AI** and the **"cursor-small"** model to document your project's purpose, technical stack, folder structure, customisations, and libraries.
- **Steps to Use Cursor AI:**
  1. **Invoke Cursor AI** with the context of your project.
  2. **Request updates** for the README.md file.
  3. **Review the suggested changes** and ensure they align with your project goals.

### Option 2: Manual Definition of Your Project Context
1. **Define Your Project Context:**
   - Search for the README file and `/docs/` folder to gather context.
   - Use the `project-definition-template.mdc` rule to document your project's purpose, technical stack, folder structure, customisations, and libraries.

2. **Follow the Guidelines:**
   - Update the README file with the necessary sections as outlined in the project definition rule.
   - Maintain clear and concise documentation for future reference.

3. **Continue with Other Rules:**
   - Once the project context is defined, proceed to implement other rules to enhance code quality and maintainability.

## üìä Managing Cursor Rules at Scale

This repository contains a significant number of rules covering multiple languages, frameworks, and security concerns. Here are some considerations and recommendations for managing rules at scale:

### Potential Constraints

1. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Each rule requires processing when Cursor AI evaluates a file
   - While individual rules have minimal impact, large collections could potentially affect performance
   - Current collection size (25+ general rules, 10 OWASP security rules) should not cause notable performance issues

2. **Rule Conflicts**:
   - Rules from different frameworks or languages might occasionally provide conflicting recommendations
   - Filter patterns help mitigate this by ensuring rules only trigger for relevant files
   - Priority settings in rule metadata can help resolve conflicts when multiple rules apply

3. **Maintenance Complexity**:
   - As the rule collection grows, testing and maintenance effort increases
   - Version compatibility across rules becomes more important to track
   - Documentation needs increase proportionally with rule count

### Benefits of a Unified Repository

1. **Simplified Installation and Management**:
   - Single installation command for all rules
   - Consistent versioning across all rules
   - Centralised documentation and examples

2. **Rule Filtering System**:
   - Built-in file extension and path filtering prevents irrelevant rule application
   - Rules for specific languages/frameworks won't be triggered for unrelated files
   - Metadata tagging allows for logical organisation without physical separation

3. **Holistic Development Experience**:
   - Comprehensive coverage across different aspects of development
   - Consistent enforcement of standards across technologies
   - Simplified onboarding for new team members

### Recommendations for Users

1. **Selective Rule Usage**:
   - Disable rules not relevant to your specific technology stack
   - Configure rule priorities based on your project's needs
   - Consider creating custom installation scripts that only install relevant rules

2. **Performance Optimisation**:
   - If experiencing slowdowns, review which rules are most frequently triggered
   - Consider disabling computationally expensive rules for very large files
   - Report performance issues so rule patterns can be optimised

3. **Custom Rule Development**:
   - When creating custom rules, follow the patterns established in existing rules
   - Use specific file filters to minimise unnecessary rule evaluation
   - Test new rules thoroughly in isolation before adding to the collection

### Future Scalability Plans

While maintaining all rules in a single repository currently provides the best developer experience, we're preparing for potential future growth:

1. **Enhanced Categorisation**:
   - Rules include clear language/framework tagging with a structured hierarchical system (As seen in the OWASP Top Ten Rules):
     - `language:php` - Explicitly identifies the programming language
     - `framework:drupal` - Specifies the framework or CMS
     - `category:security` - Defines the primary functional category
     - `subcategory:injection` - Provides more granular categorisation (e.g., injection, authentication)
     - `standard:owasp-top10` - Identifies the security standard being applied
     - `risk:a01-broken-access-control` - Specifies the exact risk identifier
   - This tagging system enables selective installation based on language, framework, or security concern
   - Installation scripts can target specific categories (e.g., only install PHP rules or only OWASP rules)

2. **Modular Design**:
   - Rule file structure supports potential future separation
   - Consistent naming conventions facilitate organisation

3. **Monitoring and Feedback**:
   - Repository growth and performance impacts are monitored
   - User feedback helps identify optimisation opportunities

If you encounter any issues with rule management or have suggestions for improving organisation, please submit an issue or pull request.

## Categorisation System

Cursor Rules now feature a structured hierarchical tagging system that enables precise rule filtering based on project requirements:

### Standardised Tag Structure

- **Language tags**: `language:php`, `language:javascript`, `language:python`, etc.
- **Framework tags**: `framework:drupal`, `framework:react`, `framework:django`, etc.
- **Category tags**: `category:security`, `category:performance`, `category:accessibility`, etc.
- **Subcategory tags**: `subcategory:injection`, `subcategory:authentication`, `subcategory:xss`, etc.
- **Standard tags**: `standard:owasp-top10`, `standard:wcag`, `standard:pci-dss`, etc.
- **Risk tags**: `risk:a01-broken-access-control`, `risk:a05-security-misconfiguration`, etc.

### Tag-Based Rule Selection

The enhanced tagging system enables selective installation of rules:

- **Project-specific rules**: Automatically select rules based on your project's languages and frameworks
- **Security-focused installations**: Target specific security concerns (e.g., only OWASP Top 10 rules)
- **Composite filtering**: Combine multiple criteria (e.g., PHP Drupal security rules)

For complete documentation of the tagging system, see [TAG_STANDARDS.md](TAG_STANDARDS.md).

### Rule Selection Script

A Python script (`select_rules.py`) is provided to automate rule selection based on tags:

```bash
# Auto-detect project type and select appropriate rules
python select_rules.py --auto

# Select rules by specific tags
python select_rules.py --tags "language:python standard:owasp-top10"

# List all available tags
python select_rules.py --list-tags
```
